# Gamesco Project
## Trend Analysis of Global Video Games Sales

### Background
The executives at a video game company would like to use data related to game sales to inform the development of new games. Specifically, they are seeking to gain insight into the popularity of different game genres and regional distinctions in sales. The objective for this project is to perform an analysis on time-series and sales data to inform future budgeting for the development of new games. 

### Tools & Context
- **Microsoft Excel:** the bulk of the analysis was performed on this spreadsheet software, including filtering/cleaning data, creating pivot tables, data visualizations, creating new variables, and descriptive analysis. 

- **Microsoft PowerPoint:**  final presentation drafted in this slide show software. 

### Data Source
Gamesco is a fictional company, however, the global game sales data used for this project is of real, available on VGChartz.com.

### Methodology
1. Analysis began with formulating detailed questions to inform the investigation, followed by understanding the data set by examining the source of data, categorizing each column as quantitative/qualitative, and assessing any biases implicit in the data. 

2. Once a fuller picture was gathered of the data set, the cleaning process of finding and treating incomplete, unclear, or duplicate data took place. Then, exploratory data analysis was performed to see how the data was distributed and to check for outliers. This was then followed by descriptive analysis to develop insight from the data.

3. A narrative was developed about data insights to present to stakeholders. The final report was prepared and consolidated into a PowerPoint presentation.
